                <h2>CHRISTOPHER BAILEY</h2>
                <p>Born in 1992, with an intense love for creativity and music, I like to see the world through more than just my eyes but experience it with my soul. I put my all into my passions and I don't bother wasting time on things i have no desire for. My true desire in life is to be able to spread love through creativity and make a living while doing so. I was taught growing up to never settle for a job you hate but instead work your hardest doing something you love and I intend to do just that!

                <h1 class="headings">Photography</h1>
                <p>In my gallery above are just a few of my favorite pictures that I have either modeled for or have taken myself. My love for photography/videography has grown over these last few years as I have grown as a creative. It is important to me that i am able to be represented through visual arts.</p>

                <h1 class="headings">Music</h1>
                <p>Music is in the very fiber of my existence. I have been apart many productions both on stage and recording studios. I have one EP, that was released in 2017, out on all major platforms, and i am currently working on my second project. I write all my songs and produce about 95% of all my music. I am currently blessed to be playing piano for the music ministry at the historic Christ Missionary Baptist Church in Indianapolis.</p>

                <h1 class="headings">CIW <br> Certified</h1>
                <p>Early 2022 I decided to take my love tech to the next level by going back to school and enrolling into the Eleven Fifty Academy to learn the basics of coding. In doing so I did get my CIW certifications which I am hoping will open many doors for my career. Though this is just the beginning in my pursuit to learning more about computers I am proud to say that i have started down the right path. </p>
